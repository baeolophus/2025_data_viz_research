education/librarianship, research, and
scholarship

This is the story of what I would do as faculty in data visualization.

## What is data-driven visualization?

-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   We use visualizations (graphs, figures, plots) for
    -   exploring 
    -   telling a story

## How easy is it to fix your graphs?

How many settings to improve this graph to publication quality?

       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm,

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
subset_penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  dplyr::filter(species != "Gentoo", year != 2007)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
subset_penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins %>%
  dplyr::filter(species != "Gentoo", year != 2007)

       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm,
                     shape = species)) +

       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  labs(x = "Penguin weight (g)", 
       y = "Flipper length (mm)") +

## Now, think about what's happening in health sciences research right now

::: {.absolute top="30%" left="25%" width="40%"}

:::

## People don't pay attention until their point of need

- Pouring energy into workshops and promotion that doesn't work [^Inside Higher Ed article recently] because people have a lot going on [Oliver Burkeman book, can't even book]
- We need workshops, but we need effective workshops


# Data-driven research and librarianship to address

- what our researchers already know
- what gets them to show up
- how to get the learning to stick


## What I would bring to this position

- Researcher in life sciences (evolutionary biology and ecology)
- 7 years of science librarianship and data and stats consultation
- R, Rshiny
- Enthusiasm for learning
  - This workshop is in Quarto

Goal: Helping people get the skills to make an impact in their chosen field





## Key tenets of my approach

- Evidence-based learner-centered pedagogy
- Human relationships and reciprocity
- Scaling sustainably


## Learner centered (The Carpentries pedagogy, disability studies, universal design)
    - Activation barriers lowering
    - Reduce "inessential weirdnesses" [^keynote]
    - People are tired (burnout can’t even book), cognitive load (teaching tech together)
    - Disability studies: universal design helps [^citation with complaints in common]

:::


## Human connection and relationships  Creating good relationships post (email citation?)

- Learner centered pedagogy is about making it more than one-way, but it's still pretty one-way
- Relationships
  - Room for vulnerability [data viz example] of lived experience [Milos Savic book]
  - CORE e-forum: we are afraid to be approachable at the risk of not being taken seriously.^[CORE e-forum 2025]
  - Social capital to be silly 
- Clear boundaries (aka the service model) are kind
  - Privacy in assessment data - really loved the UNMHS privacy page
- Justice: IRB framework for AI use



## Scaling up


"Visual [program] complexity is distracting and should therefore never be employed to a degree that exceeds the actual complexity in the data [needs]"^[Few 2021, pg 49]

:::

## Scaling in a sustainable way

- designed around campus needs and personnel skills/time
- Evidence-based what shoudl we stop doing (FLOSS keynote Sumana H): just because I really love XYZ doesn't mean people actually want/need it.
- What's the metric and why should it not be "efficiency" or quantity/dollars
- "Harm reduction": get biggest things first (evidence synthesis example from my work)


# How would these three concepts (pedagogy, relationships, scale) become scholarship?


## Workshop development and collaboration


- Scaling up the basics in workshops
  - Universal design of materials but also on how to implement
  - "Accessibility carpentries": a new program I've wanted to do
  - Opportunity for collabration with campus Carpentries and CARC
    - Listen to campus about needs and problems!
    - Listen again to both people^[Smoother meetings note] and data

- Making sure workshops are like visualizations: Possible + useful = relevant^[Kirk, 2019, pg. 130, figure 5.6]
  - There is no right answer, there is the right answer for your situation

## Studying skill retention in researcher workflows
- How much does our training impact people’s actual work products, not just the post-workshop assessment initially?
- Potential focus questions
  - what perceived need did this workshop meet?
  - what were barriers to long-term implementation?  
  - what worked for long-term implementation?  (how many people get grants because of our services^(Caryn grant))

- Methods: IRB, quantitative skills, timing (immediate, one month, six month, one year), likert analysis, Ithaka project, maps project (in progress)

- Funding/logistics
  - Survey cash for incentives
  - Adding on assessment to others' grants to get funding like CAREER grant (research and outreach, has to has an impact on teaching)

  
## Marketing vs anthropology of workshop descriptions
aka if you build it, will they actually come? (zoom fatigue vs priorities realignment)
- Free food/pizza is no longer enough: is the want/need there?  what can make this important enough?
- Plain language in library services (expand on my past work)
- What is enough to bring people in?  What tweaks to language work?^[Plain language article]
- Do we need to know why?  Who on campus could work with?[look up, esp Health outreach people]
- Health money for workshops?



## Approachability and social capital in learning
- What helps/impedes people from coming back to us for more help?
  - What interventions get people to follow up?
    - The experiments with writing prompts in classes.  do folks in those workshops come back for more help?
    - social annotation as an intervention, maybe shorten doc ???  The syllabus annotation trend.
    - Analysis of “does the asking questions doc” help. 
  - How, and should, we quantify relationships?  What gets people to listen to us if they don't know they need something.  (if they already know us, are they more likely to come to a thing they're not sure about)
 - Who has had their life changed by an HR workshop?  Unlearning series and why that workshop stuck.



## Case studies: getting to universal design
- Accessible maps and visualizations (collaboration)
- Unmet demand: sensory libguide project, experience getting into disability community
- Current research on unmet needs of disabled students, faculty, staff  mostly research on students, what about others.
- history of not being listened to, why respond to yet another survey ($ for survey, ??)
- Money from who?



## Workshop design analysis
- Methods:
  - Evidence synthesis: what works in other programs and in health education, education to inform our work
  - Text and theme analysis of design and wording choices, objectives 
  - Attendence and satisifcation Metrics... sometimes good, sometimes bad. - Workshop metrics dashboard
    - Double duty: librarian skills, reporting
    - Current work in progress at current institution: LibINsights pathway, started for marketing, implementing for attendance metrics
  - Case studies and interviews [citation for evidence based qualitative] as well as quantitative data based on outliers and typical users.  evidence-based librarianship, assessment literature. 


## AI, you knew it was coming somewhere (or not??)
- What influences human perceptions of value of AI in the researcher workflow?  Water, labor, skills (identification lab) 
- Human alternatives (statistics helper, beyond libguides or direct to libguides- what makes them work or not?)


## Data visualization wall as a meeting place

- Incorporate data visualization wall as connection node/hub https://hsc.unm.edu/hslic/services/spaces/floor-2/data-visualization-wall.html
- Three potential interactive paths to use it
  - Do you want to do something that’s an example here?
  - Do you want to feature something new?
  - Are you looking for collaborators?  Facilitating connection (a sort of ideas pollination!)




## Chance favors the prepared data visualization specialist

- Psychology R model
- Arachnid review
- Search arXiv (in progress)
- Adaptive capacity (in progress)
- Comparing early internet discussion to AI discussion now (in progress)
- ??? Who knows what here!



# A connection-focused program for data visualization scholarship

- Let's help our community tell those stories better by equipping them with tools that stick
