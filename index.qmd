## What is data-driven visualization?

-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   We use visualizations (graphs, figures, plots) for
    -   exploring 
    -   telling a story

## People don't pay attention until their point of need

- Pouring energy into workshops and promotion doesn't work on its own^[https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/07/09/essay-faculty-engagement-and-web-accessibility-opinion] because researchers have limited time and attention
- We need workshops, but we need effective workshops with long-term changes in behavior


# Data-driven research and librarianship to address

- What our researchers already know
- What gets them to show up
- How to get the learning to stick

::: {.absolute top="35%" left="49%" width="40%"}

![](images/keyboard_cat.jpg)

:::


## What I would bring to this position

- Experience
  - Trained as researcher in life sciences (evolutionary biology and ecology)
  - Now, seven years of science librarianship
- Tools: R, RShiny, more
- Enthusiasm for learning (example, this presentation is in Quarto)
- Enthusiasm for connecting people, which makes for a successful librarian-researcher^[Kennedy, Marie R., Kristine R. Brancolini, and David P. Kennedy. 2020. “An Exploratory Study of Accomplished Librarian-Researchers”. Evidence Based Library and Information Practice 15 (1):179-217. https://doi.org/10.18438/eblip29655.]

Goal: Helping people get the skills to make an impact in their chosen field



# Philosophy

## Key tenets of my approach

- Evidence-based, learner-centered pedagogy
- Human relationships and reciprocity
- Scaling sustainably





## Learner centered
- People are tired ^[A.H. Petersen, Can't Even: Why Millenials are the Burnout Generation. Press, Location.] and have limited cognitive load^[G. Wilson, Teaching Tech Together]
- Universal design helps^[Roberson, Casey Alexander, Trisha Barefield, and Eric Griffith. 2022. “Students with Disabilities and Library Services: Blending Accommodation and Universal Design.” The Journal of Academic Librarianship 48 (4): 102531. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102531.] and many things we do are just "tradition" or "inessential weirdnesses"^[S. Harihareswara. 2016. “Inessential Weirdnesses in Open Source Software (OSCON 2016).” Accessed June 10, 2025. https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2016/inessential-weirdnesses-in-open-source-software-oscon-2016/.]
- Story-based to capture you with actionable items^[Groves, Karl. 2024. “I Never Knew a Website Could Hurt Someone.” Conference. Tech Access Oklahoma, February 28. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pynKRttYlBg&list=PL0gW6noozmWHhAmq_hifHDl3x4Q2Y1RN5&index=3.]

## Learner centered = humane

::: {.absolute top="35%" left="4%" width="40%"}

![](images/cat_struggles_with_academic_book.jpg)

:::

- We need to lower activation barriers^[Theisinger, Diana. 2025. "One Inaccessible PDF at a Time". Accessed July 09, 2025.  Available at: https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/07/09/essay-faculty-engagement-and-web-accessibility-opinion]



## Connection and relationships

- Relationships
  - Room for vulnerability^[Curry 2025. Concepts of Data Driven Visualization.  osf.io/] of lived experience ^[Price, Candice, and Miloš Savić. 2022. Radical Grace: Essays and Discussions on Teaching. 619 Wreath.]
  - "We are afraid to be approachable at the risk of not being taken seriously".^[CORE e-forum 2025]
- Clear boundaries (aka the service model) are kind
  - Privacy in assessment data - really loved the UNMHS privacy page
- Justice: IRB framework for AI use^[Reece, Gwendolyn. 2025. “We Already Have an Ethics Framework for AI.” Inside Higher Ed. Accessed July 21, 2025. https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/04/25/we-already-have-ethics-framework-ai-opinion.]



## Scaling in a sustainable way

- "Harm reduction": get biggest, not always easiest, things first^[Shelby, Renee, Shalaleh Rismani, Kathryn Henne, et al. 2023. “Sociotechnical Harms of Algorithmic Systems: Scoping a Taxonomy for Harm Reduction.” Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (New York, NY, USA), AIES ’23, August 29, 723–41. https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604673.]
- Making sure our offerings meet needs^[Cogito, Ergo Sumana. n.d. “What Should We Stop Doing? (FLOSS Community Metrics Meeting Keynote).” Accessed June 10, 2025. https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2016/what-should-we-stop-doing-floss-community-metrics-meeting-keynote/.]
- Staff burnout and accessibility^[Davis, Nicollette, Mondo Vaden, Marco Seiferle-Valencia, Jess Saldaña, and DeAnn Brame. 2024. “The Library Is NOT for Everyone (Yet): Disability, Accommodations, and Working in Libraries.” College & Research Libraries News 85 (2): 58. https://doi.org/10.5860/crln.85.2.58.]


# Scholarly Output

## Taking these three concepts to my proposed program of scholarship


"Visual [program] complexity is distracting and should therefore never be employed to a degree that exceeds the actual complexity in the data [needs]"^[Few 2021, pg 49]

# Getting started with data and community

## Workshop development and collaboration

- Scaling up the basics in workshops: the datasets and experimental grounds for upcoming ideas
- Opportunity for collaboration with campus Carpentries and CARC
    - Listen to campus about needs and problems!
    - Listen again to both people^[Smoother meetings note] and data^[
DeFrain, Erica, Leslie Sult, and Nicole Pagowsky. 2025. “Effectiveness of Academic Library Research Guides for Building College Students’ Information Literacy Skills: A Scoping Review.” UNL Libraries: Faculty Publications, September 1. https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/446.]

## There is no "right" one-size-fits-all workshop!
- Making sure workshops are like visualizations: Possible + useful = relevant^[Kirk, 2019, pg. 130, figure 5.6]
- There is no right answer, there is the right answer for your situation
  - So much already exists, don't reinvent the wheel^[FORRT - Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training. n.d. “FORRT Lesson Plans.” Accessed August 15, 2025. https://forrt.org/lesson-plans/.]
  - Timeline: 2-4 new workshops a semester until rotating up to 10-20 each semester

## Workshop and asynchronous materials design
- Methods:
  - Evidence synthesis: what works in other programs and in health education, education to inform our work (2-5 years in)
  - Attendance and satisfaction metrics... easy to get if worded well
    - Current work in progress at current institution: LibInsights pathway
    - Quantitative analysis: conditional inference trees, non-parametric t-tests, contingency tables
    - What's the metric and why should it not be "efficiency" or quantity/dollars^[]


## Data visualization wall for cross-pollination

- Three potential interactive paths to use it
  - Do you want to do something that’s an example here on your own data?
  - Do you want to feature something new?
  - Are you looking for collaborators?  Facilitating connection (a sort of ideas pollination!)
- Qualitative case study until long-term (numbers of collaborations, grants)
- Timeline: year 1

## Potential course: deep dive in health sciences visualizations

- Graduate or upper-level undergraduate: bring your own data
- Literature searching to find field-appropriate data visualization types
- Exploring known human perceptions
- Discipline-specific data visualization focused on [HSC Institutional Focus Areas](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/centers-programs/)
- Setting up individual workflows for universal design^[Byrne-Haber, Shery. 2021. “Giving a Damn about Accessibility: A Candid and Practical Handbook for Designers.” UX Collective, May 18, 1–49.] in R, Python, Tableau, etc
- Timeline: year 2 or later

## Skill retention in researcher workflows: research questions

- How much does our training impact people’s actual work products, not just the post-workshop assessment initially?
  - Who has had their life changed by an HR workshop?  Unlearning series and why that workshop stuck.

- Potential focus questions
  - what perceived need did this workshop meet?  is it what we thought the need was?
  - what were barriers to long-term retention or use?  
  - what worked for long-term implementation?  (How many people get grants because of our services?  Win awards?))
  
## Skill retention in researcher workflows: implementation
- Methods: IRB experience, quantitative skills, timing (immediate, one month, six month, one year), likert analysis, interviews^[Hayman, Richard, and Erika E Smith. 2020. “Mixed Methods Research in Library and Information Science: A Methodological Review”. Evidence Based Library and Information Practice 15 (1):106-25. https://doi.org/10.18438/eblip29648.] Ithaka project^[

- Timeline: first 2-3 years
  
## Marketing vs anthropology of workshop descriptions: research questinos
- What is enough to bring people in?
- Focused questions
  - What tweaks to language work?^[Curry, Claire M., Joey Albin, Bobby Reed III, Amanda Schilling, Beth Tweedy, and Kristi Wyatt. 2024. “Plain Language Workshop Descriptions: How to Attract Participants from All Disciplines.” College & Research Libraries News 85 (8): 327–31.]

## Marketing vs anthropolgoy of workshop descriptions: implementation
- Potential collaborators: Who on campus could work with?^[look up, esp Health outreach people, marketing on main campus, anthropology, or psychology]

- Timeline: first 2-3 years


## Interventions in approachability: research questions
- What helps/impedes people from coming back to us for more help?
- What interventions get people to follow up?
- What gets people to listen to us if they don't know they need something?^[there was a citation in non-MLIS paper.])

## Interventions in approachability: implementation
- Methods (potential interventions)
    - The experiments with writing prompts in classes.  do folks in those workshops come back for more help?
    - Social annotation as an intervention, maybe shorten doc ???  The syllabus annotation trend.
    - Analysis of “does the asking questions doc” help via case study^[Robbins, Sarah, Claire Curry, Amanda Schilling, and B. N. Tweedy. 2022. “Recruiting, Hiring, & On-Boarding Non-MLS Liaison Librarians: A Case Study.” Library Leadership & Management 36 (1). https://doi.org/10.5860/llm.v36i1.7490.] and interviews^[Suarez, Doug. 2010. “Evaluating Qualitative Research Studies for Evidence Based Library and Information Practice”. Evidence Based Library and Information Practice 5 (2):75-85. https://doi.org/10.18438/B8V90M.]
- Timeline: 2-4 years

## Universal design in the library: scholarship questions
- Unmet needs of disabled students^[Brunskill, Amelia. 2021. “Without That Detail, I’m Not Coming”: The Perspectives of Students with Disabilities on Accessibility Information Provided on Academic Library Websites. February 10. https://doi.org/10.25417/uic.13807979.v1.] and faculty/staff^[Leigh, Jennifer, Josie Caplehorne, and Sarah Slowe. 2023. “Ableism and Exclusion: Challenging Academic Cultural Norms in Research Communication.” Journal of Research Management and Administration 2 (1): 1. https://doi.org/10.18552/jorma.v2i1.764.]
- Experience:
  - New sensory and accessibility libguide^[https://guides.ou.edu/access]
  
  
## Universal design in the library: implementation
- "Accessibility carpentries"^[“UDL: The UDL Guidelines.” n.d. Accessed May 1, 2024. https://udlguidelines.cast.org/.]
- Methods:
  - qualitative interviews and survey free-response^["without that detail" citation]
  - quantitative survey responses^[Stockwell, Kayden M., Zoë S. Robertson, Andrew J. Lampi, Talyn Steinmann, Erline Morgan, and Vikram K. Jaswal. 2025. “‘A System That Wasn’t Really Optimized for Me’: Factors Influencing Autistic University Students’ Access to Information.” Autism in Adulthood 7 (2): 171–84. https://doi.org/10.1089/aut.2023.0139]

Accessed August 21, 2025. https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/accessibility/accessibility-quick-cards.jsp.]


## Universal design in the library: timeline
- Potential issues: history of not being listened to^[Byrne-Haber, Shery. 2021. “Giving a Damn about Accessibility: A Candid and Practical Handbook for Designers.” UX Collective, May 18, 1–49.]
- Potential collaborators:
  - Campus disability office, student groups

- Timeline: year 3-6 (will work better with more established relationships and after hearing more about campus needs)^[Roberson, Casey Alexander, Trisha Barefield, and Eric Griffith. 2022. “Students with Disabilities and Library Services: Blending Accommodation and Universal Design.” Journal of Academic Librarianship 48 (4): 102531. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2022.102531.]
