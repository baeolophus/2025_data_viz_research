## What is data-driven visualization?
-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   We use visualizations (graphs, figures, plots) for
    -   exploring
    -   telling a story

# How much work is it to improve a graph?

## People do not pay attention until their point of need

-   Pouring energy into workshops and promotion doesn't work on its own[^1]
-   What gets researchers to show up
-   How to get improved workflows to stick

## What I would bring to this position

::: {.absolute top="20%" left="30%" width="70%"}

-   Life sciences background
-   Seven years science librarianship
-   Enthusiasm for connecting people, which makes for a successful librarian-researcher[^2]

# Philosophy

## Key tenets of my approach

-   Relationships and connection
-   Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy
-   Scaling sustainably

## Relationships and connection

-   Respect, beneficence, and justice[^3]
-   Room for vulnerability[^4] of lived experience[^5]
-   Clear boundaries (aka the service model and clear policies) are kind

## Relationships and connection: Approachability

-   Is there a cost to approachability?[^7]

Available at:  https://connect.ala.org/core/discussion/core-e-forum-weve-got-to-be-sillier-approachability-in-academic-libraries-2.


## Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy

-   Many things we do are just "tradition" or "inessential weirdnesses"[^10]

## Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy: implementation

-   People can take on limited cognitive load[^8]
-   Universal design is desperately needed[^9]

## Hidden barriers to researcher workflows: research questions

-   What changes to workshop descriptions bring in more folks?[^19]
-   Longitudinal study of what facilitates long-term incorporation of skills?
-   What is the campus impact of adding these skills?
