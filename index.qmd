## What is data-driven visualization?

-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   We use visualizations (graphs, figures, plots) for
    -   exploring
    -   telling a story

## People don't pay attention until their point of need

-   Pouring energy into workshops and promotion doesn't work on its own[^1]
-   What gets researchers to show up
-   How to get improved workflows to stick

## What I would bring to this position

::: {.absolute top="20%" left="30%" width="70%"}

-   Experience
    -   Trained as researcher in life sciences (evolutionary biology and ecology)
    -   Now, seven years of science librarianship
-   Tools: R, RShiny, more
-   Enthusiasm for learning
-   Enthusiasm for connecting people, which makes for a successful librarian-researcher[^2]

# Philosophy

## Key tenets of my approach

-   Relationships and connection
-   Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy
-   Scaling sustainably

## Relationships and connection

-   Relationships
    -   Respect, beneficence, and justice[^3]
    -   Room for vulnerability[^4] of lived experience [^5] and sharing experiences
-   Clear boundaries (aka the service model and clear policies) are kind
-   Approachability
    -   Lower activation energy to attend[^6]
    -   "We are afraid to be approachable at the risk of not being taken seriously".[^7]

## Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy

-   People can take on limited cognitive load[^8]
-   Universal design is desperately needed[^9]

## Evidence-based, accessible pedagogy = learner-centered

-   Many things we do are just "tradition" or "inessential weirdnesses"[^10]

## Scaling in a sustainable way

::: {.absolute top="20%" left="04%" width="40%"}

-   Make sure we don't lose our values when we scale up[^11]
-   Making sure our offerings meet needs[^12]
-   Staff burnout and health/accessibility[^13]

## Hidden barriers to researcher workflows: research questions

-   What need did this workshop meet?
-   What were barriers to long-term retention or use?
-   What is the campus impact of adding these skills?

## Hidden barriers to researcher workflows: implementation

-   Methods: IRB experience, quantitative skills, timing (immediate, one month, six month, one year), likert analysis, interviews[^20] Ithaka project[^21], maps project (in progress)
