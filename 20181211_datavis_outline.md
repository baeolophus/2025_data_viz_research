- Estimated time: 53 minutes
- Suggested equipment: whiteboard, erasers, markers for group discussion
- Layout
    - Works well for remote participation
        - That requires one additional helper to monitor Zoom chat for questions
    - Have people sit in groups of 2 or more

- Session goals for participants (3 min)
	- choose a sentence, table, or graph based on your question and data types [HANDOUT]
	- maximize data portrayed to a reader with minimal time, ink, and space by understanding concepts of data density, "chartjunk", and data/ink ratio
	- present your data with clarity by making symbols proportional to numbers, clear labeling, showing variation in data (not design of chart), using standardized units, illustrating data with each axis of appropriate dimensions, and providing context for data

- Getting started
    - Confirm everyone has at least one person to discuss with
    - Ask tables to introduce themselves to each other with your preferred professional icebreaker ("describe your research in 1-3 words" is a good one from Carpentries)

- Is the visualization type appropriate? (10 min)
	- Matching data and hypothesis to graph type
		- Walk through a few paths to demo the chart of charts (about 3 min each)
			- One for tables/sentences
			- One for two variables
			- One for having grouping variables

- Effective visuals (10 min)
	- Concepts
		- Accessibility: color blind color choices, font sizes (presentations vs manuscripts), optical illusions
		- Do you need additional information?
			- Adding distribution to side, internally (box-and-whisker w/scatter, violin plot)
			- Highlight statistical tests
			- Combine raw and summary graphs (scatterplot with regression line, scatter over box-and-whisker)
			- Do you have groupings in your data?
				- Lines to connect individuals
		- Data density (information per unit area) and the related data/ink ratio: maximize use of ink for data (remove extraneous grid lines and colors)
	- ACTIVITY (5 min): show examples highlight each plus a combined one so learners can critique each with
		- What is effective about this visualization choice?
		- What is not effective about this visualization choice?
- Clear visuals with context (10 min)
	- Concepts
		- Symbols and axes proportional to numbers represented (problem with pie charts, area in general)
		- Clear labels (minimize abbrevations) that are consistent with rest of presentation/manuscript terminology 
		- Reduce external variation / lack of context: Use standardized units (per capita, per weight, whatever relevant to your field), show all relevant data
		- Do not change chart design partway through (emphasize variation in data, not design)
		- Does it meet your goal, whether that's describing your data or corresponding with any statistical tests you've conducted?
	- ACTIVITY  (5 min) : show examples highlight each plus a combined one so learners can critique each with
		- What is clear about this visualization choice?
		- What is misleading about this visualization choice?

- Wrap-up / summary (2 min)
	- Match your data type and question to the graph type
	- Use visually effective aesthetics
	- Keep your visuals clear and provide context
