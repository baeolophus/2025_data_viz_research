The skills taught in this book rely primarily on something that most of us possess-vision-interactively using graphs to find and examine the meaningful patterns and relationships that reside in quantitative data. Although some questions about quantitative data can only be answered using sophisticated statistical techniques, most can be answered using relatively simple visual data sensemaking skills. Until Now You See It was published, no book taught these basic skills comprehensively and in a way that was accessible to a broad audience. Even though these skills can be developed by anyone with eyes to see, they are not intuitive-they must be learned. Without these skills, even the best data visualization tools are of little use, and data will remain nothing but noise},

Visual Thinking Processes., Information Visualization: Perception for Design is a comprehensive guide to what the science of human perception tells us about how we should display information. The human brain is a super-computer for finding patterns in information. Our understanding of visual data and visual information is greatly enhanced or impeded by the way information is presented. It is essential that visual data be designed in such a way that key information and important patterns will stand out. It is only by understanding how perception works that the best visualizations can be created. Colin Ware outlines the key principles for a wide range of applications and designs, providing designers with the tools to create visualizations of improved clarity, utility and persuasiveness. The book continues to be the key resource for practical design guidelines, based on perception, which can be applied by practitioners, students and researchers alike. Complete update of the recognized source in industry, research, and academic for applicable guidance on information visualizing. Includes the latest research and state of the art information on multimedia presentation. More than 160 explicit design guidelines based on vision science. A new final chapter that explains the process of visual thinking and how visualizations help us to think about problems.
