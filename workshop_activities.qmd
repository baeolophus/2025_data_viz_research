# Getting started (5 min)

## What we will discuss today

- Define visualizations for data

- What, why, and how of data-driven visualizations

  - What: goals

  - Why: human perception

  - How: design and defaults

- How to get more help

## Ice breakers

-   5 min ice breaker activity: A boring fact about yourself
-   Pronouns if comfortable

::: notes
5 min, use this time to let late arrivals settle in.

  - In person
    - Confirm everyone has at least one person to discuss with (in person) 
    - Provide paper copies of handouts (in person)
    - Ice Breaker at table

  - Online
    - Provide link to handouts (online)
    - Ask each person to introduce themselves in chat (online) with your preferred professional icebreaker

## Consider this visualization (5 min)

::::: columns

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```
:::


::: {#vcenter .column .fragment width="50%"}

-   What do you understand?

-   What is the message?

-   What is confusing?

## What is data-driven visualization?

-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   We use visualizations (graphs, figures, plots) for
    -   exploring 
    -   telling a story 

::: aside
Kirk, 2007, *Data visualization, a handbook for data driven design*, Publishing Company.
:::

::: notes
Exploring is often earlier in analysis or for descriptive studies.
Telling a story is often to supplement or explain a statistical analysis or describe your data.
:::

## What makes a visualization good?

What do we mean when we say "good"?

-   "trustworthy (reasonable, faithful, integrity)
-   accessible (usuable, understandable)
-   elegant (aesthetic, appealing)"

::: aside

## Again, here's what we'll cover about visualizations

- What, why, and how of data-driven visualizations

  - What: goals

  - Why: human perception

  - How: design and defaults

- The library way: lots of references to classic visualization resources you may want to read or skim!



# Goals: **What** you need the graph to be

## Trustworthy, reasonable, faithful, integrity.

-   Ensure all variables in your goal/question are in/answered by your graph
    -   Whether in axes, multiples/facets, or groupings (shapes, colors, line types)
    -   Comparisons via parallelism (Tufte 1997), small multiples (Tufte 1990, 2001)
    -   Data density (Tufte 2001)
    -   When making comparisons, show the actual difference (Robbins 2005, ch. 3)

## Field-specific thoughts

-   Library thought: what's the common way to present this in your field? Searching in captions in some databases.
-   statistics thought - what numbers are you talking about? are the relevant numbers and uncertainty shown in the graph?
    -   Collective vs individual geoms (ggplot book)

## There is no right answer, there is the right answer **for your situation**

- possible + useful = relevant (Kirk 2007:130, fig 5.6)
- graph data more than once to show different aspects.  experiment.  data desnity (224)

# Perception: **Why** graphs work

## Presentation, accessible, usable, understandable.

     
- Visual patterns as an augment to working memory limitations of humans (Few 2021:52)

- Universal design
  - Size of visualization elements (text, symbols, lines)
  - Distractions
  - Limits of human perception

## Limitations of "typical" human perception

- "Ordered Elementary Tasks" (Robbins 2005, pg 61)

::: aside
Robbins, 2005, *Creating More Effective Graphs*, Publisher.
:::

## Top three

    - position along a common scale
    - position along identical, non-aligned scales
    - length

## Getting more difficult to judge


    - angle/slope - we can do slopes, but not angles (this is part of why pie charts difficult)
    - area
    - volume
    - color hue- color saturation - density
    
::: notes
could I make this a graph with a line on it or some sort of ordering
:::


## When in doubt

Choose the principle least likely to mislead (pg 224)

## Accessibility

- Use multiple scales for one variable when possible
- Remember location of audience (paper, screen, projection)
- Remember not all minds work the same
- Remember 


# Design: **How** to communicate your message


## Keep it simple: elegant (aesthetic, appealing)
- "Never allow your design or implementation to obscure the reader"^[pg 33 Kirk book, quote by K. Elliott.]
- True message vs artifact of technique ^[Cleveland et al. Graphical Methods for Data Analysis chapter 8]
- "Visual complexity is distracting and should therefore never be employed to a degree that exceeds the actual complexity in the data"^[Few, pg 49, Now You See It]

## Making it easy to do the right thing

-   Learn how to save settings for graphs in code
-   Change defaults in point-and-click if possible, make yourself a checklist if not (screenshots!!)


## What actions to take?
- Three ways to design systematically^[Few, 2012. *Show me the numbers: designing tables and graphs to enlighten, 2nd ed*. Burlingame, CA: Analytics Press.] with details from Robbins^[Robbins, 2005, *Creating More Effective Graphs*. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Interscience.] and Tufte^[Quantiative data book]
  - Highlight
  - Organize
  - "Integrate text" (context)


## Highlight

-   Data should stand out (pg 159)
  - Important parts should be visually prominent (pg 163)
  - but use smallest effective differences (Tufte 1997)
- Do any calculations for the viewer (pg 216)
  - This means plot the variable of interest
  - Differences, not before and after

# Ending activity (10 min)

## What recommendations do you have for the original graph?

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
(original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm))
```

## Some possibilities

:::: {.columns} ::: {.column #vcenter width="50%" .fragment}

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
(original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm))
```

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = palmerpenguins::penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +
  geom_point(stat = "summary", 
             fun = mean, 
             shape = "x", 
             size = 10)+ 
  facet_wrap(island~.) + 
  labs(x = "Penguin species", y = "Flipper length (mm)")
```
