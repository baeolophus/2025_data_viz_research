# Getting started (5 min)

## Main message

-   What, why, and how of data-driven visualizations
-   Don't let defaults get in the way of your message

## Ice breakers

-   Ice breaker activities
-   Pronouns if comfortable
-   A boring fact about yourself

::: notes
5 min, use this time to let late arrivals settle in. - In person - Confirm everyone has at least one person to discuss with (in person) - Provide paper copies of handouts (in person) - Ask tables to introduce themselves to each other with your preferred professional icebreaker ("describe your research in 1-3 words" is a good one from Carpentries) - Online - Provide link to handouts (online) - Ask each person to introduce themselves in chat (online) with your preferred professional icebreaker

## Warm up your graphics brain (5 min)

::: columns
::: {#vcenter .column .fragment width="50%"}
-   What is the message of this graph?

-   What is confusing?

-   What do you understand?
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
(original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm))
```

## What is data-driven visualization?

-   Definition: "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding"
-   Use
    -   telling a story (often to supplement or explain a statistical analysis or describe your data)
    -   exploring (often earlier in analysis or for descriptive studies)

::: notes
Andy Kirk, 2007 "Data visualization, a handbook for data driven design"
:::

## What are key elements of good visualization?

Aka what is "good" here?

-   "trustworthy (reasonable, faithful, integrity)
-   accessible (usuable, understandable)
-   elegant (aesthetic, appealing)"

::: notes
These adapted from pg. in Kirk 2007

# Goals: **What** you need the graph to be

## Trustworthy, reasonable, faithful, integrity.

-   Ensure all variables in your goal/question are in/answered by your graph
    -   whether in axes, multiples/facets, or groupings (shapes, colors, line types)
    -   Comparisons via parallelism (Visual Explanation), small multiples (Envisioning Info, Quantitative Data)
    -   Data density (quantitative data)
    -   Showing comparisons and the ACTUAL QUANTITY NEEDED (change vs making ppl look at it) Robbins chapter 3

## Field-specific thoughts

-   Library thought: what's the common way to present this in your field? Searching in captions in some databases.
-   statistics thought - what numbers are you talking about? are the relevant numbers and uncertainty shown in the graph?
    -   Collective vs individual geoms (ggplot book)

## there is no right answer, there is the right answer **FOR YOUR SITUATION**

```         
- "possible" vs "useful" to show pg 130 fig 5.6 Kirk book.  possible + useful = relevant.
- graph data more than once to show different aspects.  experiment.  data desnity (224)
```

# Perception: Why graphs work

## Presentation, accessible, usable, understandable.

```         
- Visual patterns as an augment to working memory limitations of humans (pg 52, Few, Now you see it)
- Accessibility (universal design) in presentations and reading/paper/computer
```

## Limitations of "typical" human perception

```         
- Robbins pg 61 Ordered Elementary Tasks
```

## Top three

```         
    - position along a common scale
    - position along identical, non-aligned scales
    - Length
```

## Getting more difficult to judge

```         
    - angle/slope - we can do slopes, but not angles (this is part of why pie charts difficult)
    - area
    - volume
    - color hue- color saturation - density
    
```

## When in doubt

-   choose the principle least likely to mislead. (Robbins 224)

## Accessibility

-   Use multiple for same, if possible (Universal design)

# Design: how to communicate your message

## Keep it simple

-   Audience/setting/stakeholders "what is the "least this can be"? - quote by Alyson Hurt, NPR, in Kirk book. Chapter 6 Robbins talks about general principles.
-   "visual complexity is distracting and should therefore never be employed to a degree that exceeds the actual complexity in the data" (Few, pg 49, Now You See It).

## Don't let the tool get in the way of the goal

-   "never allow your design or implementation to obscure the reader understanding the central point" - pg 33 Kirk book, quote by K. Elliott.
-   True message vs artifact of technique (Cleveland et al. Graphical Methods for Data Analysis chapter 8)

## Three ways to design systematically

```         
- "Highlight", "organize", "integrate text" - Few - 2012, Clarity (pg Robbins)
```

## Highlight

-   Data should stand out (pp 159) but use smallest effective differences (Visual Explanation book).\
-   Important parts should be visually prominent (pg 163)
-   don't have reader make calculations (216). PLOT THE VARIABLE OF INTEREST.

## Organize

-   Use common baselines wherever possible (207).
-   comparisons should be legible (pp 168-171)
-   reduce interior clutter (175-183) in grids, ticks, labels
-   can you change scale? pp 190-191

## Integrate graphics with context

-   consistency with text (193)
-   label directly if not clutter (213)

## What about journals and conferences?

Publication aethetics, appealing, meeting standards - journals - talks

## Making it easy to do the right thing (5 min)

-   Learn how to save settings for graphs in code
-   Change defaults in point-and-click if possible, make yourself a checklist if not (screenshots!!)

# Ending activity (10 min)

## What recommendations do you have for the original graph?

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
(original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm))
```

## Some possibilities

:::: {.columns} ::: {.column #vcenter width="50%" .fragment}

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
(original_penguins <- plot(x = palmerpenguins::penguins$species, y = penguins$flipper_length_mm))
```

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = palmerpenguins::penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, fill = island)) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)+geom_point(stat = "summary", fun = mean, shape = "x", size = 10)
```
