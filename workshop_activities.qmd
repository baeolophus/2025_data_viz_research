## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code


## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```



## Getting started
- Ice breaker activities
- Pronouns if comfortable
- A boring fact about yourself


::: {.notes}
5 min, use this time to let late arrivals settle in.
- In person
	- Confirm everyone has at least one person to discuss with (in person)
	- Provide paper copies of handouts (in person)
	- Ask tables to introduce themselves to each other with your preferred professional icebreaker ("describe your research in 1-3 words" is a good one from Carpentries)
- Online
	- Provide link to handouts (online)
	- Ask each person to introduce themselves in chat (online) with your preferred professional icebreaker
:::

## Activity
Start with activity of critiquing a chart (10 min)
- Perhaps two versions of the same thing?
- what are differences adn what do you think about the message of the graph?

## Main message
Don't let defaults get in the way of your goal???  (the why and how of data-driven visualizations)

## Purpose What is your goal?
- "trustworthy (reasonable, faithful, integrity), accessible (usuable, understandable), elegant (aesthetic, appealing)" - Kirk  book
- "visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding" - Andy Kirk, "Data visualization, a handbook for data driven design" - the three words there
	- telling a story (often to supplement or explain a statistical analysis or describe your data)
	- exploring (often earlier in analysis or for descriptive studies)


## What? you need the graph to be: Trustworthy, reasonable, faithful, integrity.
	- Ensure all variables in your goal/question are in/answered by your graph
	- whether in axes, multiples/facets, or groupings (shapes, colors, line types) 
		- Comparisons via parallelism (Visual Explanation), small multiples (Envisioning Info, Quantitative Data)
		- Data density (quantitative data)
		- Showing comparisons and the ACTUAL QUANTITY NEEDED (change vs making ppl look at it) Robbins chapter 3
	- Library thought: what's the common way to present this in your field?  Searching in captions in some databases.
	- statistics thought - what numbers are you talking about?  raw vs collective/summaries
		- Collective vs individual geoms (ggplot book)
## there is no right answer, there is the right answer FOR YOUR SITUATION
	- "possible" vs "useful" to show pg 130 fig 5.6 Kirk book.  possible + useful = relevant.
	- graph data more than once to show different aspects.  experiment.  data desnity (224)
	
## Why graphs work Presentation, accessible, usable, understandable.
	- Human perceptual abilities (Robbins book chapter 3)
	- Accessibility (universal design) in presentations and reading/paper/computer
	- Visual patterns as an augment to working memory limitations of humans (pg 52, Few, Now you see it)
	- Robbins pg 61 Ordered Elementary Tasks
		- position along a common scale
		- position along identical, non-aligned scales
		- Length
		- angle/slope - we can do slopes, but not angles (this is part of why pie charts difficult)
		- area
		- volume
		- color hue- color saturation - density
		- choose the principle least likely to mislead. (Robbins 224)
## How: design considerations (Quantitative Data, and chapter 6 Robbins)
	- Audience/setting/stakeholders "what is the "least this can be"? - quote by Alyson Hurt, NPR, in Kirk book.  Chapter 6 Robbins talks about general principles.
	- "never allow your design or implementation to obscure the reader understanding the central point" - pg 33 Kirk book, quote by K. Elliott.
	- True message vs artifact of technique (Cleveland et al. Graphical Methods for Data Analysis chapter 8)
	- Add smallest effective differences (Visual Explanation book).  "visual complexity is distracting and should therefore never be employed to a degree that exceeds the actual complexity in the data" (Few, pg 49, Now You See It).
	- "Highlight", "organize", "integrate text" - Few - 2012, Clarity (pg Robbins)
		- Highlight
			- Data should stand out (pp 159)
			- visually prominent (pg 163)
			- common baselines wherever possible (207).  area vs volume difficult.
		-organize
			- comparisons should be legible (pp 168-171)
			- reduce interoir clutter (175-183) in grids, ticks, labels
			- can you change scale?  pp 190-191
			- don't have reader make calculations (216).  PLOT THE VARIABLE OF INTEREST.  plot improvement vs before and after.  (216-217).
		- Integrate text and labels
			- consistency with text (193)
			- label directly if not clutter (213)
		




## PS More how: Publication aethetics, appealing, meeting standards
- journals
- talks
Making it easy to do the right thing (5 min)
- Learn how to save settings for graphs in code
- Change defaults in point-and-click if possible, make yourself a checklist if not (screenshots!!)


## Ending activity (10 min)
- Original graphs, what would they recommend fixing now?
