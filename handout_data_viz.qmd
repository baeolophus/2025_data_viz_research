# Checklist for data-driven visualizations

University of Oklahoma Libraries

## What: goals

Know if you are telling a story or exploring your data.  Then, consider these points:

- [ ] Include the relevant variables from your research question
- [ ] Check your field's literature or journal's style guide for example visualizations
- [ ] Consider if you need more than one visual to tell your story

## Why: human perception

People (including you, the author) need to read and see your visualization to understand your story.

- [ ] Make lines bolder, symbols larger, and font larger than software defaults
- [ ] Use perceptually accurate representations such as common baselines, small multiples, or length
- [ ] Remove perceptually inaccurate representations like angles or slope, area, volume, and colors for quantitative scales

## How: design and defaults

Make changes to your visualization to tell your story more clearly.  Most program defaults are not designed for presentations, universal accessibility, or ease of reading.

### Highlight

- [ ] Make data visually prominent
- [ ] Use smallest effective change/contrast for differences
- [ ] Do any calculations for the viewer

### Organize

- [ ] Use common baselines wherever possible to make group comparisons
- [ ] Use small multiples to show otherwise overlapping groups
- [ ] Reduce interior clutter in grids, ticks, labels, etc


### Integrate with context

- [ ] Label variables and data consistent with text
- [ ] Use consistent symbology in related visualizations
- [ ] Label directly on visuals where possible
