# What: goals

Know if you are telling a story or exploring your data.  Then, consider these points:

- [ ] Include all variables from your research question
- [ ] Checked your field's literature or journal's style guide for example visualizations
- [ ] Consider if you need more than one visual to tell your story

# Why: human perception

- [ ] Make lines bolder, symbols larger, and font sizes larger than the program default
- [ ] Use perceptually easy representations such as common baselines, small multiples, or lengths
- [ ] Remove perceptually confusing representations like angles, volume, area

# How: design and defaults

Make changes to your visualization to tell your story more clearly.  Most program defaults are not designed for presentations, universal accessibility, or ease of reading.

## Highlight

- [ ] Make important parts visually prominent[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 163]
- [ ] Use smallest effective change in symbol to show differences[@tufteVisualExplanationsImages1997]
- [ ] Do any calculations for the viewer[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 216]
- [ ] Enlarge symbols and labels as much as possible without obscuring data

## Organize

- [ ] Use common baselines wherever possible to make group comparisons[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 207].
- [ ] Comparisons should be legible (pp 168-171)
- [ ] Can you change scale [to show more]? pp 190-191
- [ ] Reduce interior clutter[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, pp 175-183] in grids, ticks, labels

## Integrate with context

- [ ] Label variables consistent with text[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 193]
- [ ] Label directly on visuals where possible [@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 213]
