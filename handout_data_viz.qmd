# What: goals

Know if you are telling a story or exploring your data.  Then, consider these points:

- [ ] Include the relevant variables from your research question
- [ ] Check your field's literature or journal's style guide for example visualizations
- [ ] Consider if you need more than one visual to tell your story

# Why: human perception

- [ ] Make lines bolder, symbols larger, and font sizes larger than software defaults for viewing ease
- [ ] Use perceptually accurate representations such as common baselines, small multiples, or length[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 61]
- [ ] Remove perceptually inaccurate representations like angles or slope, area, volume, and colors for quantitative scales[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 61]

# How: design and defaults

Make changes to your visualization to tell your story more clearly.  Most program defaults are not designed for presentations, universal accessibility, or ease of reading.

## Highlight

- [ ] Make data visually prominent[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 163]
- [ ] Use smallest[@tufteVisualExplanationsImages1997] effective[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, pp 168-171] change for differences
- [ ] Do any comparison calculations for the viewer[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 216]

## Organize

- [ ] Use common baselines wherever possible to make group comparisons[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 207]
- [ ] Reduce interior clutter[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, pp 175-183] in grids, ticks, labels
- [ ] Use small multiples to show otherwise overlapping groups[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 171]

## Integrate with context

- [ ] Label variables consistent with text[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 193]
- [ ] Label directly on visuals where possible [@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 213]
- [ ] Use consistent symbology in related visualizations[@robbinsCreatingMoreEffective2005, p 221]
