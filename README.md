# Logistics
## Estimated time
- 50 minutes

## Suggested equipment
### in person
- whiteboard
- erasers
- markers for group discussion

### Zoom/online
- Host status for zoom to be able to create breakout rooms and moderate

## Format
### in person
- Have people sit in groups of 2 or more if in person.
- One helper optional

### Zoom/online
- One helper optional but nice-to-have if completely online
- Randomly or alphabetically assign breakout rooms at group discussion if completely online.


### Hybrid (remote/in-person)
- Works well for hybrid participation if more than one person in each format.  We are now moving away from hybrid to alternating occurence of remote and in-person, as remote tends to result in only one person showing up in person, which is not conducive to participation.
- Hybrid requires one helper to monitor Zoom chat for questions
