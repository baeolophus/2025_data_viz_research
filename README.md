- Estimated time: 53 minutes
- Suggested equipment: (in person) whiteboard, erasers, markers for group discussion.  (Zoom/online): randomly assigned breakout rooms (requires host status for zoom)
- Layout
    - Works well for remote participation
        - That requires one additional helper to monitor Zoom chat for questions
	- One helper optional but nice-to-have if completely online
    - Have people sit in groups of 2 or more if in person.
    - Randomly or alphabetically assign breakout rooms at group discussion if completely online.

- Session goals for participants (3 min)
	- choose a sentence, table, or graph based on your question and data types [HANDOUT]
	- maximize data portrayed to a reader with minimal time, ink, and space by understanding concepts of data density, "chartjunk", and data/ink ratio
	- present your data with clarity by making symbols proportional to numbers, clear labeling, showing variation in data (not design of chart), using standardized units, illustrating data with each axis of appropriate dimensions, and providing context for data

- Getting started (5 min)
    - Confirm everyone has at least one person to discuss with (in person)
    - Provide paper copies of handouts (in person)
    - Provide link to handsouts (online)
    - Ask tables to introduce themselves to each other with your preferred professional icebreaker ("describe your research in 1-3 words" is a good one from Carpentries)
    - Ask each person to introduce themselves in chat (online)
    
- Why visualization is important (2 min)
	-Give example of John Snow's map of cholera cases and public pumps to determine that cholera was water-borne.  A good visualization can save lives!
	
- Is the visualization type appropriate? (5 min)
	- Matching data and hypothesis to graph type.

- Effective visuals (10 min)
	- Concepts
		- Accessibility: color blind color choices, font sizes (presentations vs manuscripts), optical illusions
		- Do you need additional information?
			- Adding distribution to side, internally (box-and-whisker w/scatter, violin plot)
			- Highlight statistical tests
			- Combine raw and summary graphs (scatterplot with regression line, scatter over box-and-whisker)
			- Do you have groupings in your data?
				- Lines to connect individuals
		- Data density (information per unit area) and the related data/ink ratio: maximize use of ink for data (remove extraneous grid lines and colors)
- Clear visuals with context (10 min)
	- Concepts
		- Symbols and axes proportional to numbers represented (problem with pie charts, area in general)
		- Clear labels (minimize abbrevations) that are consistent with rest of presentation/manuscript terminology 
		- Reduce external variation / lack of context: Use standardized units (per capita, per weight, whatever relevant to your field), show all relevant data
		- Do not change chart design partway through (emphasize variation in data, not design)
		- Does it meet your goal, whether that's describing your data or corresponding with any statistical tests you've conducted?
- Real life examples (10 min)
	- Assign people randomly to breakout rooms (or group by table in person) and ask them to choose a visualization from one of the links on the slide.
	- Leave slide up with suggested discussion questions
	- Around 5 min into this section, ask each group to share a link to their graph and highlight something answering one of the discussion questions.  (will work better online?)

- Find more help slide (5 min)
	- Describe items
	- Leave up

- Please help us improve with feedback (3 min)
	- Survey link
